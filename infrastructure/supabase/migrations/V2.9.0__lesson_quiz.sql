-- =============================================================================
-- V2.9.0 - Lesson quiz
-- A quiz written from the lesson the teacher taught (coaching transcript) or
-- planned (a Rumi lesson plan), shared with the class by one link.
--
-- ADDITIVE ONLY. Three nullable/defaulted columns on quizzes, three more
-- statuses on its CHECK, three indexes, one nullable column on
-- quiz_share_codes. Nothing here changes existing rows or existing code paths;
-- the feature stays off until TRANSCRIPT_QUIZ_ENABLED=true.
-- Fresh installs get the same shape from 00_complete-schema.sql.
--
-- ALL OR NOTHING. The whole change is one DO block, so it is one statement: if
-- any part fails, nothing is left applied, whether this file is run by psql,
-- the SQL editor or infrastructure/scripts/migrate.js. (A BEGIN/COMMIT pair
-- would not do: migrate.js runs the file inside its exec_sql function, where
-- transaction commands are refused.) Safe to run again.
