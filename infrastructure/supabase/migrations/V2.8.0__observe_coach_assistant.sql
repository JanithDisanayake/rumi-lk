-- V2.8.0 - Observe: the coach's assistant
--
-- Adds what /observe needs on an existing deployment. A fresh install gets the
-- same shape from 00_complete-schema.sql + 01_rls-policies.sql. Additive only:
-- every statement is IF NOT EXISTS, nothing is dropped or rewritten.

--   coaching_sessions  + observation_type / observer_user_id /
--                        autofill_analysis_data / debrief_status
--   users              + role (the coach role family reads it) + school_id
--   schools            one row per school a coach can be assigned
--   leader_schools     which schools a coach holds; the coach's teachers are
--                      DERIVED from it (leader_schools x users.school_id), never
--                      stored a second time
--   observation_schedules  one upcoming visit per (coach, school, teacher)
--   coach_directory    coach -> work email, only for the optional calendar
-- =============================================================================

-- A leader observation is a coaching_sessions row like any other, so the whole
-- transcription + analysis pipeline is reused. user_id is the observed teacher
-- (or the coach on a bare capture, until the teacher is named); the coach is
-- observer_user_id. NULL observation_type = the teacher's own recording.
