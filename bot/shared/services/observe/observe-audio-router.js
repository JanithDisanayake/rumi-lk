/**
 * The ONE place that decides what a coach's audio means.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: audio reaches the bot through two entry points —
 *   1. a voice note / audio message → voice-message.handler
 *   2. an audio FILE (document)     → the document branch in whatsapp-bot.js
 * A phone recorder app delivers a 40-minute lesson as a FILE, so path 2 is the
 * NORMAL way a coach sends a classroom recording. Intercepting only path 1
 * lets file-sent recordings sail past /observe into the TEACHER coaching flow.
 *
 * The duration is resolved HERE, not trusted from the caller: inbound webhooks
 * rarely carry one (Meta never does for voice notes; Matrix sends file size
 * only), so a caller-computed "is it long?" is almost always false. The router
 * asks the channel for the media info, and probes the bytes with ffprobe when
 * only a large file size is known.
 *
 * Invariant: a coach's classroom-length audio NEVER starts a teacher coaching
 * session — not on a lost state, not on a Redis blip, not on a capture
 * failure, not on an unresolvable duration with a large file.
