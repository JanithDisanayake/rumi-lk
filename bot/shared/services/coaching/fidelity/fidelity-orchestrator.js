/**
 * The lesson-plan fidelity orchestrator a coaching analysis calls.
 *
 * Plan text (a plan Rumi made for the teacher, an uploaded document, or pasted text — resolveFidelitySources decides
 * which) → the prescribed move list (lp-upload-extractor) → per-move verdicts on the timestamped transcript
 * (fidelity-analyzer) → a deterministic score (fidelity-scorer). Returns the blob persisted as
 * analysis_data.lp_fidelity, or a status.
 *
 * NON-BLOCKING BY CONTRACT: this never throws. Each way it can fall short is its own status, because each tells the
 * teacher something different (fidelity-messages.js):
 *   lp_absent            no plan was linked to the session
 *   ok + unusable_guard  the transcript has no [MM:SS] timings, so the recording cannot be judged move by move —
 *                        decided HERE, in code, before any model call (no extraction, no grading, no spend)
 *   lp_unparseable       the plan has no readable text, or the extractor found no moves in it
 *   fidelity_unavailable the grader failed (its reason is kept as `cause`)
 * The caller gates on isFidelityEnabled() before calling, so the feature ships OFF.
 *
 * The no-timestamps guard exists because a transcription fallback that silently drops speaker turns also drops their
 * stamps. Left to the grader, a stampless transcript can come back as 0% and "lesson mismatch" — a teacher with a
 * bad recording blamed for a lesson they taught. The guard takes the model out of that decision.
 *
 * LP_FIDELITY_RUNS=N (odd, at most 5) grades N times concurrently and keeps the median scored run whole; every run's
 * percentage and the spread are persisted as telemetry; no person-facing prompt sees them (the voice note gets only
 * the band, fidelity-report.js#projectForVoice). Unset = one call plus one retry.
 *
 * All collaborators are injectable (deps) for unit testing.
