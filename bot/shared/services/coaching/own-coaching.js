/**
 * A teacher's OWN coaching sessions — never a coach's observation of them.
 *
 * Observe files a coach's observation under the observed teacher
 * (coaching_sessions.user_id) with observation_type set, and its score is the
 * coach's rating. So every read of "this teacher's sessions" — their trend,
 * prior feedback, chat context, /status, counts — goes through ownCoaching(),
 * which adds `observation_type IS NULL`.
 *
 * The column arrives with the observe migration. A bot deployed before that
 * migration must keep computing a teacher's coaching exactly as before:
 * PostgREST would answer "column does not exist", and these readers degrade
 * quietly, so the teacher would get an empty trend and "no prior sessions"
 * with Observe never switched on. The column is therefore probed once per
 * process (probe(), called at start-up): without it the filter is skipped —
 * such a database holds no observations to skip — and the missing migration
 * is logged as an error. Until the probe answers, the filter is applied.
