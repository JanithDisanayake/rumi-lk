/**
 * Share a video quiz with a class, and record what they score.
 *
 * WHY A LINK AND NOT THE QUESTIONS THEMSELVES
 * The obvious design — the teacher forwards the quiz messages into their
 * class WhatsApp group — cannot work, and the reason is platform law, not
 * our gap:
 *   1. Forwarding STRIPS interactivity. A forwarded button/list/Flow arrives as
 *      dead text; taps never reach our webhook, so nothing can be recorded.
 *   2. The bot cannot sit in an ordinary group. The Groups API caps membership
 *      at 8 and prohibits interactive messages even there.
 * What forwards perfectly is a LINK. So the teacher forwards ONE message
 * carrying a wa.me link with a code; each child taps it, lands in their own 1:1
 * chat with Rumi, gives a name and class, and takes the full quiz — media,
 * feedback and all — with every answer stored and attributed to them.
 *
 * A child arriving this way sees who sent it and what it is about before
 * anything else: "Your teacher <name> sent you a quiz on <topic>."
