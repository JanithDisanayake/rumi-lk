/**
 * Plan quiz — the KEY CHECK, between authoring and the hand-off.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A singular/plural quiz written from a lesson plan once went
 * out with one item keyed to the lesson's own planted misconception: "what do
 * you do to make the plural of this word?" → "its form will not change". The
 * plan said the opposite three times — a vocabulary definition, the check that
 * plants exactly this mistake for the class to correct ("A friend says the
 * plural stays the same — are they right?"), and the homework answer. The author
 * is handed the misconception so it can build WRONG options from it, and once in
 * a couple of dozen items it made it the RIGHT one. The validator checks shape,
 * language, level and pictures; nothing compared a key with the lesson. A quiz
 * that teaches children the misconception is the worst thing this feature can
 * send.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. A plan quiz (lp_generated) is written from a written source, so
 * its keys can be checked against that source: ONE LLM call through the
 * pipeline's JSON client is shown the plan as written and asked, per item,
 * whether the KEYED option agrees with it, and returns
 * `{index, verdict: consistent|contradicts|unclear, quote}`. The prompt tells
 * the checker which statements in a plan are WRONG on purpose — the mistakes it
 * warns about and the claims it puts to the class to test.
 *
 * What the generate step does with a contradiction (re-author once through the
 * existing targeted rewrite, re-check, drop, or fail as `key_conflict`) lives
 * in `transcript-quiz-generate.service.js`, beside every other recovery step.
 *
 * TWO CONTRACTS ASSERTED IN CODE, not left to the prompt:
 *   - a reply with no `verdicts` array is a FAILED check (the caller fails open
 *     and says so at error), never "every key is fine";
 *   - a verdict outside the three values, or an item the reply skipped, is
 *     `unclear` — it neither blocks the quiz nor counts as a pass.
 *
 * A transcript quiz has no written source, and a topic quiz has no source at
 * all: neither is checked here (the blind solve still checks both).
 * Pure except for the one LLM call: no DB, no WhatsApp, no R2.
